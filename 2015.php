<h1>Albums that came out this year</h1>

<h2>Joey Bada$$'s <i>B4.Da.$$</i></h2>

<p>This album dropped January 20 with an astounding force and proved that Joey Badass
    is still relevant in the rap game. Songs like "Paper Trail$" and "Christ Conscious"
have the vigor of younger Joey's style. I rate this album a 7.6/10, all around it is solid 
conceptually and musically</p>

    <h2>BADBADNOTGOOS and Ghostface Killah's <i>Sour Soul</i></h2>
    <p>
        <i>Sour Soul</i> was a ground breaking collaborative between classic East Coast rapper Ghostface Killah
        from the Wu Tang Clan and BBNG (BADBADNOTGOOD) who are a jazz trio that are taking the Hip Hop scene by storm. The jazzy feel
        brought out by BBNG mixes extremely uniquely with Ghostface's in your face style and creates a masterpiece of an album. I would 
        rate <i>Sour Soul</i> a 6.8/10 because the two artists chemistry is still a little shaky but expected.

    <h2>Drakes's <i>If You're Reading This it's to Late</i></h2>
    <p>
        Pop star Drake released his sixth album on Feb 13. The album features Lil Wayne, PARTYNEXTDOOR and
        Travi$ Scott and it is one of the biggest commercial album of the year selling 835,000 copies. The songs "Energy"
        and "Legend" are some of the best songs Drake have produced and this album is definitely worth a once listen through.
