            <h1>A Look Back at the Hip-Hop Hits of 2014!</h1>    
            <p>The year of 2014 was a great year for fans of hip-hop music. I'm going to mention some of the biggest hits of the year. To start, artist YG released <i>My Krazy Life</i>. This album was the first big release of a gangsta rap album and strongly benefits from DJ Mustard's beats. Another hit release was the second eponymous album release from rap group Run the Jewels. The album has strong lyricism with beats that are different from the mainstream. <i>Cadillactica</i>was another big release come from southern rapper, Big K.R.I.T. On the album, he proves he is capable of deeper lyricism and experiments with his voice as a musical tool. Another big release was <i>Faces</i>by Mac Miller. Although only a mixtape, the release carries the polish of an album and Miller shows his continued growth as a lyricist and explores deeper into the abstract. Finally, but not least, is Schoolboy Q's latest release, <i>Oxymoron</i>. Spawning many singles, this album cemented Schoolboy Q as a popular solo act outside of Black Hippy.</p>
