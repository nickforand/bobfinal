    <h2>Frank Ocean's <i>Boys Don't Cry</i>(?)</h2>
    <p>
        Frank Ocean is a singer and song writer from California that has made a big name for himself after his debut album <i>Nostalgia, Ultra</i>
        and his second release <i>Channel Orange.</i> Frank takes on a modern R&B feel to his music and has been hinting at releasing the possibly named<i>Boys Don't Cry</i>
        for awhile now. When this album drops definitely check it out. Here is a song of his last album titled "Thinkin Bout You."

    <h2>Kanye West's <i>So Help Me God</i></h2>
    <p>
        The music mogul Kayne West is back at it again and is on the verge of releasing his 8th commercial album and is collaborating with 
        artists such as Paul McCartney and Vic Mensa. Anything Kayne puts out is interesting due to his inflated ego and music ability. A couple
        singles have been released from the album so it is likely to drop soon. Here is one single off <i>So Help Me God,</i> "All Day."

    <h2>Chance the Rapper and the Social Experiment's <i>Surf</i></h2>
    <p>
        Chance the Rapper stormed the scene with his last album <i>Acid Rap</i> which was released in 2013. Chance has more recently 
        joined the group "The Social Experiment" and they have leaked a couple singles off of it including the song "Sunday Candy."
